				<h1>Ideas for Further Development</h1>

				<ul>
                    <li>Rather than write a site that reads like a book. Just focus on providing visually interesting linear explanations of various subjects. A bit like the site that shows how rich Jeff Bazos is. Or something more simple, but just start with a question, like: why do people say capitalism is the root cause of climate change; and then work through step by step showing why. Or, state a fact, and then show a list of the evidence for that fact. With this approach I can just build these pages as i think of them or come across the need to explain a specific point. And perhaps these can all be linked up to create a narrative.</li>
                    <li>Introduction - There are a lot of people who aren't doing anything about climate change. They might understand the issue to some degree. They get it's serious. And yet they're not personally doing much about it. This site is for them. To try to explain climate change not in an abstract academic way but as the genuine life threatening emergency that it is and what they need to do about it. Hopefully resulting in them taking action. </li>
                    <li>Section in the intro on how to approach the subject of climate change. Being open to new ideas. Letting go of fixed opinions or identity. Understanding how science works.</li>
                    <li>Section on "Are you doing enough?". With the aim to help people understand what action they should be taking. And try to help them realise, if they are not taking sufficient action, why not.</li>
