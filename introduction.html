				<p>
					Climate change is an existential threat to life on Earth. That's a difficult thought to wrap your head around. Many peole have a sense that climate change is an important issue. But not so many are taking action on a scale proportionate to the risks.
				</p>
				<p>
					Most people have seen documentaries and reports on the news: heatwaves, floods, forest fires, melting ice sheets. But perhaps these events still seem distant in time and geographically. Perhaps we think someone else is on the case. Governments have net zero plans. Corporations are going green. We'll fix this with technology.
				</p>
				<p>
					But let's be clear. Emissions are still rising. The global temerature is rising. Climate change is preceding at a faster pace than predicited. Governments and corporations are not acting on their pledges. And those pledges do not even keep us within acceptable levels of risk.

					Understanding Climate Change
				</h1>
				<p>
					If you search "climate change" you'll get back a lot of science about climate and weather. That's not the most important information. If your house is on fire what you want to know is how to respond. How to get out, how to put it out. You might also want to know what or who started the fire. You don't really need to understand the chemistry of fire.
